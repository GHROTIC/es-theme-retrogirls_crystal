THEME OPTIONS (All can be found under UI settings > Theme Configuration)
=============

Color Scheme: The theme supports multiple color schemes which you can change here.

Homepage Layout: A choice of 5 different homepage layouts

System Logo Style: A choice of logo styles for the homepage and gamelists, colour, mono, and also controller which works well with the horizontal layout

Background Images: A choice of two wallpaper sets

Help Icons: The default icon set uses A (east), B (south), X (North), Y (West). If you are using an xbox style controller then you can switch to Crystal (Reverse). Alternatively there are icon sets for each major platform that reflect their button colours and position. 

System Logo on Gamelists: Can be toggled off if you have overlap between gamelist and icons on very small screen devices

Theme Background Music: this can toggle on or off independant of your global settings. So that if you only want your own music and not any additional themes from this set they will not play (and even when set to  yes you own music will ALWAYS take precedent)

Video Delay On Gamelist: Adjust how long it takes before the screenshot or image on gamelists turns to video (from no delay to 3 seconds) 

Video on Detail View: Game video's can now be turned off completely on detailed vews


================================

Still to do:
