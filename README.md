**This theme is intended for EMUELEC and only contains graphics for systems supported by EmuElec**

==============================

Artwork for custom collections for most major games should be themed. If something is missing, raise an issue and will add them.

Dynamic Collections
===================

Dynamic Collections currently supported for the following (theme name in brackets): 

Game Series: Art of Fighting (aof), Batman (batman), Castlevania (castlevania), Cavestory (cavestory), Crash Bandicoot (crash), Dragon Ball Z (dbz), Donkey Kong (donkeykong), Doom (doom), Double Dragon (doubledragon), Fatal Fury (fatalfury), Final Fantasy (finalfantasy), Final Fight (finalfight),  King of Fighters (kof), Super Mario (mario), Megaman (megaman), Metal Slug (metalslug), Metroid (metroid), Mortal Kombat (mortalkombat), Resident Evil (residentevil), Sonic the Hedgehog (sonic), Silent Hill (silenthill), Streetfighter (streetfighter), Tomb Raider (tombraider), Legend of Zelda (zelda)

Automatic Collections (Arcade)
==============================

The various publisher themes will work from automatic collections:

Arcade Publishers & Platforms: Atari, Capcom, CPS1, CPS2, CPS3, Daphne, Data East, Irem, Kaneko, Konami, Midway, Namco, Neo-Geo, Nintendo, SEGA, SNK, Taito, Toaplan


As well as 2 player, 4 player, never played, favourites etc etc

To Do list: Acclaim, Alpha Denshi, Atlus, Banpresto, Cinematronics, Eighting/Raizing, Exidy Inc., Gaelco, Gottleib, Evoga, Strata, Incredible Technologies, Human Amusement, Falcon, Afega, Apple Industries, Unico, Tecmo and logos for Kaneko and Toaplan need redoing.  

To create a dynamic collection:

+ Go into settings > Game collection settings and select "Create new Dynamic collection"

+ Name the collection in line with one of the theme names (in brackets) above

+ Then, in the filters, in "find games" put the search phrase for instance "mario" to include all games that have mario in the title. 

Additionally you can specify platforms, genre's and other filters. I plan to add custom themes for major studios such as EA, Sega, Eidos, Codemasters etc

==============================

Adding additional systems / collections. 

If you wish a system added that is not there, raise a git issue and I will add.

===============================

THEME OPTIONS (All can be found under UI settings > Theme Configuration)

Color Scheme: The theme supports multiple color schemes which you can change here.

Homepage Layout: A choice of 5 different homepage layouts

System Logo Style: A choice of logo styles for the homepage and gamelists, colour, mono, and also controller which works well with the horizontal layout

Background Images: A choice of two wallpaper sets

Help Icons: Multiple options for help icons

System Logo on Gamelists: Can be toggled off if you have overlap between gamelist and icons on very small screen devices

Theme Background Music: this can toggle on or off independant of your global settings. So that if you only want your own music and not any additional themes from this set they will not play (and even when set to  yes you own music will ALWAYS take precedent)

Video Delay On Gamelist: Adjust how long it takes before the screenshot or image on gamelists turns to video (from no delay to 3 seconds) 

Video on Detail View: Game video's can now be turned off completely on detailed vews


================================

Still to do:

+ Translations need doing for all non-english languages

+ various other custom collections (fighting, racing etc etc)
