**This theme is intended for EMUELEC and only contains graphics for systems supported by EmuElec**

==============================

Artwork for custom collections for most major games should be themed. Again, if something is missing, raise an issue and will add them.

Dynamic Collections currently supported (theme name in brackets): 

Game Series: Art of Fighting (aof), Batman (batman), Capcom (capcom), Castlevania (castlevania), Cavestory (cavestory), Crash Bandicoot (crash), Dragon Ball Z (dbz), Donkey Kong (donkeykong), Doom (doom), Double Dragon (doubledragon), Fatal Fury (fatalfury), Final Fantasy (finalfantasy), Final Fight (finalfight),  King of Fighters (kof), Super Mario (mario), Megaman (megaman), Metal Slug (metalslug), Metroid (metroid), Mortal Kombat (mortalkombat), Resident Evil (residentevil), Sonic the Hedgehog (sonic), Silent Hill (silenthill), Streetfighter (streetfighter), Tomb Raider (tombraider), Legend of Zelda (zelda)

Arcade Publishers: Irem (irem), Namco (namco), Konami (konami), Midway (midway), Atari (atari), Data East (dataeast), Kaneko (kaneko), Nintendo (nintendo), SEGA (sega), SNK (snk), Taito (taito), Toaplan (toaplan)

Platforms: CPS1 (cps1), CPS2 (cps2), CPS3 (cps3),

Genres: Arcade (arcade), 

To create a dynamic collection:

+ Go into settings > Game collection settings and select "Create new Dynamic collection"

+ Name the collection in line with one of the theme names (in brackets) above

+ Then, in the filters, in "find games" put the search phrase for instance "mario" to include all games that have mario in the title. 

Additionally you can specify platforms, genre's and other filters. I plan to add custom themes for major studios such as EA, Sega, Eidos, Codemasters etc

==============================

Adding additional systems / collections. 

If you wish to manually add unsupported systems the following assets are needed for each new system / collection:

+ theme_name.xml in ./systemview/systems

+ backgrounds in ./assets/backgrounds/ and the relevant folders (jpg format)

+ system logos (svg format), controllers, consoles (png format) in ./assets/logos/ and then relevant folders

+ system description in language files in /lang/

================================

To do

+ Translations need doing for all non-english languages

+ various other custom collections (fighting, racing etc etc)
