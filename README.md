**Further customized version of Crystal theme** <br>
Original creators project: https://github.com/dm2912/Crystal and modification: https://github.com/farfenkugell/es-theme-farfenkugell_crystal

Main changes are: 

- Made compatible with 4:3 resolution by replacing images with alternate 640 x 480 versions. Systems that are WIP have the same placeholder art.
- Stock widescreen images removed and replaced with farfenkugell's 720p revision as a fallback
- Modified TheRA Logo added for Cpu Scripts/Advanced Options
- There is no music added, thus you should disable it or at-least showing Song Title in Sound Settings
- Scrape images on the device, not computer, as it will make sure images are proper size and prevent pixelation on gamelist
