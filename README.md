Original creators project: https://github.com/dm2912/Crystal 

Main changes are: 

- Changed default settings to show true potential of theme. 
- Adjusted Game name size to fit on RGB10, some games with longer name would simply not fit

- There is no music added, thus you should disable it or at-least showing Song Title in Sound Settings
- Scrape images on the device, not computer, as it will make sure images are proper size and prevent pixelation on gamelist
