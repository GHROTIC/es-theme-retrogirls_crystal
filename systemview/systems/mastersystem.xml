			<text>The Master System is a third-generation video game console that was released by Sega in 1985. The original SMS could play both cartridges and the credit card-sized "Sega Cards,". The Master System was a direct competitor to the Nintendo Entertainment System and was technically superior to the NES, which predated its release significantly.</text>
